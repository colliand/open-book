# Atlas of Digital Villages

J. Colliander  
2024-12-12

+++

Explore ideas to build an Atlas of "Digital Villages" supported by 2i2c.org.
1. Design a template for Atlas entries
2. Build a version of the template for CryoCloud
3. Access Grafana/Prometheus or KPIs data for each hub

## Notes

> from a (private) [GitHub issue](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/564)
>
+ Grant(s) that fund the community, Grant abstracts
+ mission statement; possible impact of the community, e.g. manage North America's water resource for CIROH; improve forecasting and resilience to earthquake events in the Cascade region for CRESCENT
+ Community composition. Population. Demographics. List of champions. Who pays for 2i2c? Who pushes boundaries of support? Who is on the job market? Who will soon write a grant? Who are the hackers or technical champions? Who wants to learn more about cloud-native workflows? Are there gatekeepers? Are there ambassadors? Are there different stakeholder archetypes in the community (career stage distribution, emergency responders, policy makers, government lab personnel, ...)
+ Main data sources. Code snippets on how to access data sources.
+ Most relevant scholarly literature. Zotero collection of important results associated to this community's research line. Leading researchers in the research area who are outside the disciplines.
+ Community notebook gallery. E.g. Pangeo gallery. Static renderings of showcase notebooks that can be launched into Binder or inside the community's hub. Leveraging Thebe using the 2i2c.binder service.
+ URLs for Digital village news. A blog stream for news in the village.
+ URLs for training and documentation resources used by the community.
+ Identify scientific linkages with other communities. Which other 2i2c communities are closely connected to this community?
+ notebooks that pull in data from Grafana
